            The point is that, if you are getting this message instead of the character uploader, then for sure, your web browser doesn't work!
            if you are using Chrome, it will not work, because Java no longer works on Google Chrome, and same with Firefox!, so for that, you will need like an Add-on or something... I recommend IE Tab!
            If you use Internet Explorer or Safari, then it should work fine! but it might look worse on Internet Explorer... Sorry for the Inconvenience...
